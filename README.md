# Is this just an exact copy of the course?

Not exactly. While i did follow along with the great tutorials in the course, I have made some modifications. 
Mostly to catching errors and displaying error messages to the user if/when they run into them while using the app.
I may make further changes as time goes on.

# How do I use the App?
1. Register/sign-in
2. Find an image with a face in it (google ect.)
3. Right Click and select 'Copy Image Location'
4. Paste the link into the input field
5. The app will display the image with a blue box around the face
